  Hey there! 
  
After more than 6 years in the world of journalism and communication, I decided to give a new direction to my career by moving into the wonderful world of data. Student at HETIC in Master Data Analytics & Digital Marketing, I am currently a data analyst/scientist on an apprenticeship in a start-up that is developing an IoT solution for the digitalisation of retail outlets.
